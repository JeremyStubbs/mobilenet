This repo uses a pretrained model from https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection. The instructions for using this model were found at https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API. 

The pre-trained model is saved as frozen_inference_graph. It is used to evaluate the test image.
